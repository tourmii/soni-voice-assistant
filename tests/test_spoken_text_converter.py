"""
Unit tests for the SpokenTextConverter class.

This test suite validates the text-to-speech conversion functionality,
covering various text formats including percentages, times, currency,
years, decimal numbers, mixed text, special cases, and mathematical notation.
Each test function uses parameterized test cases to verify the accurate
conversion of text into its spoken form.
